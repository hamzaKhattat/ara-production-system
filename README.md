# Asterisk ARA Dynamic Call Router - Production System

A production-level dynamic call routing system with full Asterisk Realtime Architecture (ARA) integration.

## Features

- **Full ARA Integration**: All Asterisk configuration stored in MySQL
- **Dynamic Call Routing**: Real-time call flow management between multiple providers
- **DID Pool Management**: Dynamic DID allocation and release
- **Load Balancing**: Multiple algorithms (round-robin, weighted, priority, etc.)
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time provider health checks
- **High Availability**: Redis caching, connection pooling, automatic failover
- **Security**: Call verification at each step
- **Observability**: Prometheus metrics, health endpoints, structured logging
- **CLI Management**: Comprehensive command-line interface

## Architecture

The system implements the call flow as specified:
1. Call arrives at S1 â†’ Routes to S2 with ANI transformation
2. S2 allocates DID and forwards to S3
3. S3 returns call to S2
4. S2 routes to S4 with original ANI/DNIS
5. S4 completes the call

## Quick Start

### Using Docker Compose

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository>
cd ara-production-system

# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Initialize database
docker-compose exec ara-router ./router -init-db

# Add providers
docker-compose exec ara-router ./router provider add s1 --type inbound --host 192.168.1.10
docker-compose exec ara-router ./router provider add s3-1 --type intermediate --host 10.0.0.20
docker-compose exec ara-router ./router provider add s4-1 --type final --host 172.16.0.30

# Add DIDs
docker-compose exec ara-router ./router did add 18001234567 18001234568 --provider s3-1

# Create route
docker-compose exec ara-router ./router route add main s1 s3-1 s4-1

# Monitor system
docker-compose exec ara-router ./router monitor
# ara-production-system
